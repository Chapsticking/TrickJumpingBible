# What is Trick Jumping?
Pulled straight from Wikipedia:

Trick Jumping is a form of movement, usually in video games, that is used to enhance the mobility of the player when jumping, often in a way which demonstrates skill or expertise, or is visually impressive. These methods are sometimes unforeseen by the creator of the game.

# Who is this Wiki for?
This is mainly for new people that want to get into the Trick Jumping hobby in Halo. This Wiki also serves as an archive to all the knowledge the jumping community has gathered up until now. 

# Why do we Trick Jump?

> I love the methodic process of finding and doing a jump. When I'm working on a difficult jump for days and sometimes months I usually start to lose my sanity. Sometimes I even start questioning if the jump is possible. However, once that jump gets landed I feel immediate relief and excitement.

> It's taking the most basic form of a game, it's movement, and pushing it as far as possible. Usually for no real purpose other than making videos out of it. A lane of videos that I find more rewatchable than normal montages. I think jumping is to games as tech skating is to skateboarding.

> I've always been fascinated by game design and found it more fun trying to break the game instead of playing it the way it was intented. For me, breaking out and exploring outside the playable areas on Halo 2 was more fun than playing matchmaking. That soon turned into navigating a map which the game developers hadn't planned on. I still jump to this day because it's turned into an art form. It's a way to express my creativity.

> I started jumping because it gave me an edge over other players. Now I jump for the challenge and puzzle of coming up with a new concept for a jump, working out the problems to make it work or make it even better. Then of course that feeling when you finally land it. When you have gotten the hang of trick jumping mechanics, pulling off those technical abilities and having fluid movement throughout a map is very satisfying.
