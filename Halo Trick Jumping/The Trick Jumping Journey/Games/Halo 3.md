# Controller or [[KBM]]?
Controller gives you an advantage to movement because you can "slow walk/run" any direction with the only downside being precision aiming is much more difficult.

<span style="color:#3cb685">Personally I use [[KBM]]</span>, it gives you the advantage of aim in short periods of time and the downside being no ability to control the movement speed of the player. Another added benefit to KBM is you are allowed to crouch at full movement speed. Also, you can bind your crouch to your scroll wheel making you crouch at incredible speeds allowing you to wedge into certain places for pressure launches with ease.
