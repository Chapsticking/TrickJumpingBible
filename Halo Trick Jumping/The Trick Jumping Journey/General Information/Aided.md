# Aided Jumping ðŸ§¨ðŸ’£ðŸ’¥

This branch of trick jumping holds no punches. You can utilize any equipment to accomplish the jump. Don't be afraid to mix in [[Un-Aided]] jumps with the aided type. Usually mixing the two can result in some fantastic results. 

Something to keep in mind with Aided jumps if your using them explicitly for a [[Stack]]. You don't want the jump to become [[Over-Powered]].
