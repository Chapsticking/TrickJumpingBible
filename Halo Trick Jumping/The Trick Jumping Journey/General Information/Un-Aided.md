# Un-Aided Jumping ðŸ¤»

This branch of trick jumping does not require equipment such as grenades, rockets, or explosives. 

This is usually associated with competitive game play because you usually don't want to trade shield/health for maneuverability. If your intending to utilize Un-Aided jumps in competitive play I recommend you are very comfortable with it first. The last thing you want to do is lose a match because you were eaten by the [[Guardians]] because you weren't confident on a certain jump.
