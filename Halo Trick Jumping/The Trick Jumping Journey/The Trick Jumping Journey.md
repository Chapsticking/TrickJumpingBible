# The Trick Jumping Journey ðŸ§­

Welcome to the start of a long and difficult journey - this hobby certainly is not for everyone; but if you stick it out it can be a very rewarding and satisfying experience.

# Disclaimer

First we need to set the record straight on a few things. You need to decide what you will be using this knowledge for. If you are a competitive player and your just wanting to know some new methods to out-gun your opponent than your learning / thought process will be much different from a standard trick jumper and vice versa.

For the competitive players, I recommend you mainly focus on [[Un-Aided]] jump techniques. However, don't let this sway you in not wanting to learn all the other types of jumping techniques, you can still pull some of them off and score some sick snippets that you can send to Single Halo Clips!

# Whats the difference between [[Aided]] and [[Un-Aided]] jumps?

The main difference is using equipment / explosions in a jump ([[Aided]]) or jump without it ([[Un-Aided]]).


# Jumping Techniques by Game
Select a game from the table below to learn the jumping techniques on that game. The stars next to the game indicate how much I enjoy jumping on it (this metric is completely biased).

Each technique is categorized by class.

# The Methodology 

So you want to pull off impossible stunts, penta-ghosts, leap off cones, be apart of a sweet video, EXPLOSIONS!? Well pump the breaks there Jimmy we gotta talk about finding jumps (preferably the *new* kind). 

So how does someone "find" a jump? Here's my usual process.

Step 1 (choose any): 
1. Pick a spot on a map and find a clever way to get to it
2. Pick a starting spot and find a place to land
3. Find a new gimmick and exploit in a jump
4. Have jump concept you want to use than sync it with a map.

Step 2:
1. Digest surroundings
2. Have a plan
3. Cross verify it with another trusted jumper, ensure what your attempting isn't old, ask for feedback if there's something that could be done better with the jump.
4. If your a loner / don't really have any connections to the jumping community ask yourself the same questions.

Step 3: 
1. Attempt
2. Re-plan if needed
3. Attempt
4. Land it

# I landed it! What do I do now?
There are lots of people in the HTJ discord that are looking for jumping content for projects coming in the future. Ask around!

Also, don't get discouraged if your jump isn't up to par for a video yet. Get back on the horse and try another jump or expand on the jump you already landed. Make it better, cleaner, or smoother. 

Also, if you still can't find a way to show off your jump just post it in HTJ or to send it to someone like Single Halo Clips.

# Resiliency
Feeling down because you've been trying the same jump for the last hour or two and you can't even get close? Get some help from the people that have been there before you. Do not suffer in silence. 

Are you pressing the same buttons over and over again so much that you forget how to even move your character? This is the sign to take a break and get a nights rest in. For some reason your fingers will get together in a meeting while your sleeping and figure out what the fuck they're supposed to be doing. You'll wake up the next day and that jump will feel 10 times easier due to the "finger meeting" the night before.

# What Makes a Jump "Good"
"*Art is in the eye of the beholder, and everyone will have their own interpretation.*"

<span style="color:#3cb685">To me </span> there are a few key factors that give me the "Good Jump" impression. However, this is **extremely biased** and many people have very different opinions regarding this subject. With that in mind, here's what I go by to determine if <span style="color:#3cb685">my own</span> jump is decent. 

(In no particular order)
1. **The [[Gimmick]] of the jump:** Would the gimmick create "shock and awe" to the audience. Is there even a [[Gimmick]]? If not will the other parts of this jump still create surprise?
2. **The Unexpectedness of the jump:** Does the jump have a crazy "twist" about it? Will the setup of the jump giveaway the entire jump before its done? 
3. **Appropriate power ([[Aided]]):** Can this jump be done with less power? Am I using the appropriate tools to get the job done? Is the jump [[Over-Powered]]
4. **Maxing Out**: Is the jump fully exhausting all its potential? Could the jump have been landed in a better spot? Any obvious things I could have done better? Could I have done that without [[save-jumping]]?
5. **Bountied**: Is this a jump that the community has dreaming of before and no ones hit it yet?
6. **[[Elements per Jump]]**: Is there at least 2 or more elements in the jump?
7.  **Good Looking**: Does the jump "look/feel" good to watch. Is it satisfying?
